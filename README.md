:star:  **Weekly report**

This week, I learned how to build a class from scratch. With many different requests for the class or features, we could build our class specifically for certain purposes, like checking if the value is valid, if the data type is correct, if the constructor has default values as we expected, etc. By manipulating the methods in the classes, we could make our class more special as requested. Also, in the test class, I learned to test different edge cases instead of only testing our expected input values. Then, I moved to the driver class, and I started to think about using my classes as a real user, trying to build an objective with the user's request and play with it.

For the following extensions, I'm expecting to have more introduction videos for analysis of a complex class with multiple objectives, like showing what the class is building like this and the adjustment of class is applied to which requests when asked to build this class, why we build class like this. I hope I could get 98-100 grades this week since I tried my best to cover more extension practices, and all my classes are working as expected.
