:star:  **Additional support sources I found**
  - This is a YouTube playlist with 399 episodes, it provides tons of information regarding Data structure and Algorithm, and OOP [Here it is](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLFbd8KZNbe-9MNUoTVeKrIACuTrhIEFNA&si=wTKgoYZPPDAE5kWP)

  - This is another YouTube playlist with the more practical class of Java [Here it is](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLmOn9nNkQxJFvyhDYx0ya4F75uTtUHA_f&si=J_cSmsael55iVlNd)

  - I found this book is popular regarding Java programming, I will use it as a supporting document while watching videos. The book name is “Head First Java: A Brain-Friendly Guide”
    
  - The last source I use very frequently is Google. Basically, I Google everything I wasn’t quite sure about and watch how other people resolve similar questions. Then I practice my own   method after careful thinking.

:star:  **Weekly report**

In the first week, I did a lot of exploring and troubleshooting while building my laptop configuration and Java environment. It's my first time using Eclipse and IntelliJ and I realized different IDE have their pros and cons.
I learned how to organize Java projects through IDE and how to build and implement Junit test cases with industry-standard, it benefits any audience for my code for a long time, also including myself. By starting code Java, I think started to build concepts and get a peak on the OOD, everything code in Java is under Class and everything is an objective. It seems like a really fun programming mindset and more fit to the thinking logic of humans. 

The expectation for incoming modules, I hope I could apply the OOD method to build some executable projects, like small games, and systems, and create my own projects to help with my recent works. I try to make my submission more "user friendly" for the reviewer, hopefully, I could get grading in the range of 98-100. Thank you.
